Server Side Rendering with Create React App
===========================================

I saw this great little article on Medium by Ben Lu, where he added SSR, Express, Redux and React Router to Create React App:

He originally based it on this article: https://medium.com/@patriciolpezjuri/using-create-react-app-with-react-router-express-js-8fa658bf892d#.sckywa9cy

My React dream is to have a server-side rendered React app, using KeystoneJS backend as that's my CMS of choice.
I thought others may want the same so I forked and added it.

Included in this repo:
- react scripts
- redux
- react-router
- keystone
- lodash

Install
-------
```bash
npm i -g yarn
yarn
yarn run build
yarn run start:server
```
